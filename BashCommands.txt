Bash Commands

Create a new text file with some text in it:
echo "Some text" > NewTextFile.txt

Verify it was created by showing its contents:
cat NewTextFile.txt

Append more text to the file:
echo "Some more text" >> NewTextFile.txt

echo prints a newline, and the >> tells the shell to append that newline to the file, creating it if it doesn't already exist.
